In this tech prototype you can test the Player Controller and Guard AI.
Once the player is within the guard's cone of vision, the Guard will
chase the player until the player breaks line of sight, at which point
the Guard will move to the player's last known location, wait for a bit, 
then return to their patrol. Currently, nothing happens when the Guard 
catches the player. In the finished game, a cutscene will play in which
the guard picks up the player, and the screen fades to black.

Controls:
Look - Mouse
Move - WASD
Sprint - Shift (hold)
