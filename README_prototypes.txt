GP2Team8_HWG_Prototype_ART

In this Art prototype, you can inspect the models we've created for the Guard, Player, McGuffin, 
and one of our decorative models. The Guard and McGuffin are fully complete, with models, textures, 
and particle effects. The Player model is currently WIP, as we plan to add a basic texture to it and
increase the subdivision to smoothen the design. The head will likely be removed in the final build 
as to not obstruct the TrueFPS player camera.

In this tech prototype you can test the Player Controller and Guard AI.
Once the player is within the guard's cone of vision, the Guard will
chase the player until the player breaks line of sight, at which point
the Guard will move to the player's last known location, wait for a bit, 
then return to their patrol. Currently, nothing happens when the Guard 
catches the player. In the finished game, a cutscene will play in which
the guard picks up the player, and the screen fades to black.
