In this Art prototype, you can inspect the models we've created for the Guard, Player, and McGuffin. 
The Guard and McGuffin are fully complete, with models, textures, and particle effects. The Player 
model is currently WIP, as we plan to add a basic texture to it and increase the subdivision to
smoothen the design. The head will likely be removed in the final build as to not obstruct the 
TrueFPS player camera. 

Controls:
Look - Mouse
Move - WASD
Sprint - Shift(hold)
